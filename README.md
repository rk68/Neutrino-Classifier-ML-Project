Abstract: Accurate identification of neutrino properties (flavour, interaction, scattering
type etc.) is crucial to the study of neutrino oscillations in the NoVA experiment. This
study describes an application and comparison of a MVCNN (Multi-View Convolutional
Neural Network) algorithm to to classify muon neutrino (νμ) charged-current events based
solely on photo-detector images, resulting in satisfactory performance (F1 score: 0.82).
Adaptations of the MVCNN were applied to regression of neutrino energy (MAE: 6.12) and
lepton to neutrino energy ratio (MAE: 0.16), as well as classification of neutrino flavour
(F1 score: 0.83) and scattering type (F1 score: 0.48).
